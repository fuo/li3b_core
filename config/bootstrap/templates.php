/**
 * The following filter allows any library's templates to be overridden.
 * This allows for greater control over the look of your application when
 * using 3rd party libraries without mucking around in the library code
 * which can, of course, lead to all sort of maintenance issues.
 *
 * Ultimately, we need to allow the following to happen:
 * 1. If there are no override templates, then the layout and view template will be used from the library (default behavior).
 * 2. If there are templates placed in `/views/_libraries/library_name/`, use those.
 * 3. Try the main application, because we don't want to change how Lithium works by default.
 * 4. If Libraries::add() passes a config that specifically says to use Lithium Bootstrap layouts, do so (forced situation, but there's still a fallback).
 *
 * Also, we need to consider elements and how they may need to work.
 * A similar system is provided for elements as well.
 *
 * Note: That this is all assuming a library is being used.
 * The main application will be completely unaffected.
 * This means that if you wish to use Lithium Bootstrap layouts, elements, etc.
 * in your main application, you will need to pass a library key of `li3b_core`
 * in many cases. For example, elements.
 *
 * Example:
 * $this->_render('element', 'navbar', array('user' => $this->request()->user), array('library' => 'li3b_core'));
 *
 * This would render the `nvarbar` element from Lithium Bootstrap. If the
 * main application also has a `navbar` element, it won't conflict. This means
 * all other libraries wishing to use this element should specify the library.
 * This is how you normally need to do it. Lithium Bootstrap isn't trying to
 * take over your Lithium application. However, when it can, it will try to
 * be flexible and fall back to a default in case you forget or don't want
 * to specify a library.
 *
 * For further example, libraries by default will render their own
 * templates, layouts, and elements because the request will have the
 * library set and the rendering system will use that by default.
 *
 * -- That's how Lithium works by default. We aren't changing that. --
 *
 * However, since we want to allow libraries to be built for and use
 * Lithium Bootstrap, we have the fallback to templates under li3b_core
 * when possible. That means if you somehow installed a library like that
 * without Lithium Bootstrap, you'd have missing templates.
 *
 * Moral of the story here is that if you are making a library for use
 * with Lithium Bootstrap, you should let people know...OR you should
 * provide all of the templates you need so that it can render pages on
 * its own. That means copying all of the layouts, CSS, JavaScript, etc.
 * Yea...A lot of duplication. That's why this template system filter
 * exists on the Dispatcher.
