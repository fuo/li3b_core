     * Returns a static block.
     *
     * Much like static menus, Static blocks are defined as arrays.
     * The content key under each array for the block name/identifier
     * should hold the final output.
     *
     * This method is filterable so the blocks can be added to or changed.
     *
     * How do they get ordered? They are in alphabetical order, much like
     * statis menus. So name the keys under each block something that
     * will put them in the desired order.
     *
     * Since multiple libraries may use the same block, you will also
     * want to keep block identifiers something fairly unique. Prefixing
     * the name with the library name is probably a good idea.
     *
     * Of course multiple libraries may wish to use the same exact block,
     * but may then have an issue with ordering because they were written
     * by two different authors (or something changed or you didn't write
     * either library and want to re-arrange the natural order).
     * So in this case, you can apply an ordering to any static block
     * via a filter in your main application. Just make sure you apply
     * the filter AFTER all the libraries have been loaded to ensure
     * it is called last.
     *
     * This method will be called by a helper that will then loop
     * the array to render the content.
     *

     * @param array $options
