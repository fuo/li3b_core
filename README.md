li3b_core
=========

This is the core library for Lithium Bootstrap.
It holds all of the functionality and core assets.
Most likely you will be using the li3_bootstrap repository
for a new project and that includes this library automatically.

However, if you like, you can clone this to your project.
Keep in mind that you may have some conflicting routes.
Also keep in mind that there may be other configuration
conflicts between your application and Lithium Bootstrap
and also other libraries that have been built for use
with Lithium Bootstrap.

### Dependencies

This library relies on li3_flash_messages:
